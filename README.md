Buildableeyecandy
=================

Enjoy, being able to build eye candy objects, somehow some items have proper path blocking. <-- comment by Radagast: That could be why we had to change some classes to Eyecandy because Special was blocked? At least in the newest Atlas the special items in the special folder are not longer placable but that shouldn't block it. We need rocket Mute Lovestone back.
